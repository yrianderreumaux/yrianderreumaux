### Hi there, 

Iâ€™m a Senior Quantitative UX Researcher at Google with expertise in mixed-methods research, data science, and psychology. My work bridges strategic and tactical UX research, using a wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods to inform product decisions and improve user experiences.

I hold a PhD in Social Psychology from the University of California, Riverside, where my research focused on how people gather information, update beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty. At Google, Iâ€™ve worked across Chrome, Android, and developer tools, tackling challenges in privacy, safety, and security while bridging technical constraints with real-world user needs.

Iâ€™m passionate about data-driven storytelling, designing rigorous research frameworks, and making complex systems more intuitive and user-friendly.
