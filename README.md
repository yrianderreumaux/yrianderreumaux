### Hi there, 

Iâ€™m Yrian Derreumaux, a Senior Quantitative UX Researcher at Google. I have a PhD in Social Psychology from the University of California, Riverside, where I studied how people gather information, update their beliefs, and make decisions in various environments.

I apply a mix of strategic and tactical UX research to tackle complex user challenges. My approach blends quantitative and qualitative methods to understand user needs more deeply.
